      <h2>Safe, Clean & Comfortable Operatories</h2>
      <p>Our response to the pandemic was quick and decisive. The safety of our patients and staff is non-negotiable. We quickly added glass barriers in the reception area, and our operatories were enclosed with glass doors. The HVAC system was upgraded and engineering study done to confirm the appropriate air exchanges. Each operatory is also equipped with with a state of the art air scrubber. We are proud to provide you with the safest environment possible.</p>

        <h3>Digital X-ray Systems</h3>
        <p>Our X-ray systems use low radiation to provide high quality radiographs of your teeth and supporting bone and tissues. We will take two types of radiographs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Intraoral</h4>
            <p>these require a small plate to be placed inside your mouth next to the teeth.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Panoramic</h4>
            <p>takes a full image of upper and lower jaw and surrounding structures. You will be asked to stand for this one while the X-ray head rotates around you.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Intraoral Camera</h3>
        <p>A small camera that fits into your mouth allows us to capture high quality images of the oral cavity. this helps to provide you with clear explanations of the current dental condition and possible treatment options.</p>
      </div>

        <h3>Cerec Omnicam</h3>
        <p>This is a digital scanner that uses advanced CAD/CAM technology. It creates a 3D map of the teeth and the surrounding soft tissues. It is used in treatment planning of more complex cases a as well as fabricating of crowns, bridges, veneers, implant crowns, night guards and orthodontic retainers.</p>
        <p>This technology allows us to avoid the mess and inconvenience of the traditional dental impressions.</p>

      <h3>First Appointment</h3>
      <p>On your first visit we conduct a thorough exam including medical and dental history. We ask that you bring a list of any medications you take. We can often request records from your previous dentist to avoid additional cost. The initial exam allows us to formulate a comprehensive plan for your dental care.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Financial Policy</h3>
      <p>Payment is due when your treatment is completed. We understand that dental treatment can be costly, so we do offer optional payment plans for your convenience.</p>
      <p>We accept cash, debit cards, and the majority of major credit cards.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Insurance</h3>
      <p>We will be more than happy to submit your insurance claims. They are submitted electronically so it usually does not take very long for your reimbursement.</p>
      <p>We will submit predetermination forms on your behalf so that you are aware of any out of pocket costs.</p>

    <h3>Feeling Anxious? We Get it.</h3>
    <p>We know better than anyone that no one likes going to the dentist. We believe that respecting patients and gently explaining things at every step goes a long way towards putting them at ease and making their visit as stress-free as possible.</p>
    <p>For patients who experience anxiety we offer nitrous oxide to help reduce feelings of stress or discomfort. Nitrous oxide is a safe and effective sedative that is administered through a small mask placed over your nose.</p>

        <h3>Dental Fillings</h3>
        <p>For cavities or broken teeth, we offer tooth-colored composite resin restorations using the Bioclear technique, which utilizes clear matrices to produce lifelike contouring of restored teeth through injection molding of heated resin material. This approach results in strong and aesthetically superior dental fillings.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Tooth Extraction</h3>
        <p>Occasionally a tooth may become hopeless and needs to be removed. We can provide a comfortable tooth extraction in many cases. For more complex cases we will refer you to one of our local oral surgeons. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Endodontics</h3>
        <p>Root canal or endodontic treatment is necessary for teeth with large decay, severe trauma or fractures, or abscesses or inflammation causing pain. Crowns are recommended to protect the treated teeth from fracture. In complex cases, we may recommend a visit to a root canal specialist.</p>
      </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Night Guards and Sports Appliances</h3>
        <p>Night guards protect teeth from grinding and are most effective at night when people are not aware of their grinding. These guards separate teeth and slightly open the mouth, preventing damage. Contact sports like hockey and football pose a risk of tooth and soft tissue injuries as well as head injuries like concussions, which a properly fitted sports guard can help prevent.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Crowns and Bridges</h3>
        <p>Crowns or "caps" are used to restore severely damaged teeth or protect root canal-treated teeth from fracture and restore function. They cover the whole tooth or replace missing structure. Bridges replace one or two missing teeth. We use digital scanning in cases of advanced restorations.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Dental Implants</h3>
        <p>Dental implants are used to replace one or more missing teeth. They are placed into the bone surgically by a specialist. Once they are integrated into the bone a crown, a bridge or even a denture can be attached them.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Dental Veneers</h3>
        <p>Dental veneers are thin, tooth coloured facings for your teeth that bonded in place. They help correct spacing between teeth as well as their colour, size and contour.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Nitrous Oxide Sedation</h3>
        <p>Nitrous oxide sedation is available for anxious patients during dental procedures. This involves breathing in a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen through a mask, producing a relaxed feeling while remaining conscious and able to respond. After the procedure, patients are put on oxygen and usually return to normal within 10 minutes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Teeth Whitening</h3>
        <p>Your teeth change colour naturally over the lifetime. Teeth whitening can help you get a much brighter and bites smile. Take home whitening treatment is available at our office. Custom trays that fit over your teeth will be fabricated which you will wear at home every day for 2-3 weeks.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Oral Sedation</h3>
        <p>A sedative may be prescribed to a more anxious patient to produce a moderate level of relaxation. You will need someone to drive you from the appointment as you can not operate a vehicle while on these types of medication.</p>
