      <h2>Safe, Clean and Comfortable Rooms</h2>
      <p>Our dental practice has adopted very quickly during the pandemic. We took the situation very seriously and made the necessary changes as fast as possible. As you walk into our reception area you will notice the glass barrier that was added. Our operatories were enclosed with glass doors. The HVAC system was upgraded to keep our patients and staff safe. The engineering study was done to confirm the appropriate number of air exchanges per hour. Each operatory is also equipped with a state of the art air scrubber. The safety of our patients and staff is our priority.</p>

        <h3>Digital X-ray Systems</h3>
        <p>Our X-ray systems use low radiation to provide high quality radiographs of your teeth and supporting bone and tissues. We will take two types of radiographs:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <h4>Intraoral</h4>
            <p>these require a small plate to be placed inside your mouth next to the teeth.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h4>Panoramic</h4>
            <p>takes a full image of upper and lower jaw and surrounding structures. You will be asked to stand for this one while the X-ray head rotates around you.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Intraoral Camera</h3>
        <p>A small camera that fits into your mouth allows us to capture high quality images of the oral cavity. this helps to provide you with clear explanations of the current dental condition and possible treatment options.</p>
      </div>

        <h3>Cerec Omnicam</h3>
        <p>This is a digital scanner that uses advanced CAD/CAM technology. It creates a 3D map of the teeth and the surrounding soft tissues. It is used in treatment planning of more complex cases a as well as fabricating of crowns, bridges, veneers, implant crowns, night guards and orthodontic retainers.</p>
        <p>This technology allows us to avoid the mess and inconvenience of the traditional dental impressions.</p>

      <h3>First Appointment</h3>
      <p>On your first visit we conduct a thorough exam including medical and dental history. We ask that you bring a list of any medications you take. We can often request records from your previous dentist to avoid additional cost. The initial exam allows us to formulate a comprehensive plan for your dental care.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h3>Financial Policy</h3>
      <p>Payment is due when your treatment is completed. We understand that dental treatment can be costly, so we do offer optional payment plans for your convenience.</p>
      <p>We accept cash, debit cards, and the majority of major credit cards.</p>
    </div>
    <div>

        <h3>Comprehensive Examination</h3>
        <p>Early detection of dental problems is crucial for maintaining a healthy and attractive smile.

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Dental Hygiene</h3>
        <p>Our qualified hygiene team provides quality care through regular removal of plaque and tartar, essential for gum and bone health that supports teeth.

      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Pediatric Dentistry</h3>
        <p>We find treating and educating children of all ages highly rewarding. Our services include preventative and restorative care, such as dental cleanings, fluoride treatments, simple extractions, and orthodontic monitoring, with nitrous oxide sedation available for anxious patients. We aim to make visits enjoyable and stress-free to promote lifelong oral hygiene habits and ensure lasting beautiful smiles. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Dental Fillings</h3>
        <p>For cavities or broken teeth, we offer tooth-colored composite resin restorations using the Bioclear technique, which utilizes clear matrices to produce lifelike contouring of restored teeth through injection molding of heated resin material. This approach results in strong and aesthetically superior dental fillings.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Tooth Extraction</h3>
        <p>Occasionally a tooth may become hopeless and needs to be removed. We can provide a comfortable tooth extraction in many cases. For more complex cases we will refer you to one of our local oral surgeons. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Dental Veneers</h3>
        <p>Dental veneers are thin, tooth coloured facings for your teeth that bonded in place. They help correct spacing between teeth as well as their colour, size and contour.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Crowns and Bridges</h3>
        <p>Crowns or "caps" are used to restore severely damaged teeth or protect root canal-treated teeth from fracture and restore function. They cover the whole tooth, replace missing structure, and look great. Bridges replace one or two missing teeth. We use digital scanning for treatment planning and fabricating these advanced restorations.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Dental Implants</h3>
        <p>Dental implants are used to replace one or more missing teeth. They are placed into the bone surgically by a specialist. Once they are integrated into the bone a crown, a bridge or even a denture can be attached them. Dental implants are an excellent option for restoring a beautiful and fully functional dentition.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Endodontics</h3>
        <p>Root canal or endodontic treatment is necessary for teeth with large decay, severe trauma or fractures, or abscesses or inflammation causing pain. This involves removing the pulp, cleaning and shaping the canal(s), and filling the canal, typically in one visit. Crowns are recommended to protect the treated teeth from fracture. Although most treatments are done in our office, complex cases may require a visit to a root canal specialist.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Night Guards and Sports Appliances</h3>
        <p>Night guards protect teeth from grinding and are most effective at night when people are not aware of their grinding. These guards separate teeth and slightly open the mouth, preventing damage. Contact sports like hockey and football pose a risk of tooth and soft tissue injuries as well as head injuries like concussions, which a properly fitted sports guard can help prevent.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Teeth Whitening</h3>
        <p>Your teeth change colour naturally over the lifetime. Teeth whitening can help you get a much brighter and bites smile. Take home whitening treatment is available at our office. Custom trays that fit over your teeth will be fabricated which you will wear at home every day for 2-3 weeks. ask us if you are a candidate for take home whitening procedure. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Nitrous Oxide Sedation</h3>
        <p>Nitrous oxide sedation is available for anxious patients during dental procedures. This involves breathing in a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen through a mask, producing a relaxed feeling while remaining conscious and able to respond. After the procedure, patients are put on oxygen and usually return to normal within 10 minutes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3>Oral Sedation</h3>
        <p>A sedative may be prescribed to a more anxious patient to produce a moderate level of relaxation. You will need someone to drive you from the appointment as you can not operate a vehicle while on these types of medication.</p>
